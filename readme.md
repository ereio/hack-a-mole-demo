# Hack A Mole
## a whack a mole game that was clearly hacked together
 
### Requirements:

**Create a simple Whack-a-mole game:**
1. The game should be hosted behind a login screen. 
2. The game should keep track of current user’s high score and the top 5 scores of all users. A score is one point for each “mole” whacked during a game (registered as a mouse click).  
3. A simple timer mechanism begins and ends each game. 
4. The user can adjust the rate at which “moles” appear. 

Write your frontend in JS (or typescript) using either React or Vue as your framework. The backend can be done in Node or Cloud Functions.  
We are not looking for or expecting a professionally polished game; rather we would like to see a demonstrated understanding of the technologies used and for you to be able to discuss the development decisions that were made along the way to creating the game. Please commit often and provide tests where you feel appropriate.
